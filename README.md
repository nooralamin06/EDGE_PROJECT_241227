# Transport Database Management System

## Introduction

The Transport Database Management System is a project conducted using Oracle DBMS. This system is designed to manage and maintain data related to transportation operations, including vehicles, routes, schedules, and passenger information. The primary goal of this project is to streamline transport operations and improve data management efficiency.

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a database system that caters to various aspects of transportation management. The database is designed to handle large volumes of data and ensure efficient retrieval and manipulation of transport-related information.

### Key Features

- **Vehicle Management**: Track and manage data related to vehicles, including registration details, maintenance records, and operational status.
- **Route Management**: Maintain information about transport routes, including start and end points, intermediate stops, and route schedules.
- **Schedule Management**: Manage schedules for different transport services, ensuring timely operations and efficient use of resources.
- **Passenger Information**: Store and manage passenger data, including booking details, travel history, and feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Database Management System**: Oracle DBMS
- **Programming Languages**: SQL, PL/SQL
- **Tools**: Oracle SQL Developer, Oracle Data Modeler

## Installation and Setup

To set up the Transport Database Management System, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transport-database-system.git
   cd transport-database-system
2. **Database Setup:**

- Ensure you have Oracle DBMS installed and running.
- Create a new database user and grant necessary privileges.
3. **Import Database Schema:**

- Use Oracle SQL Developer or any other SQL client to run the provided schema scripts.
## Usage

When the database set up is complete, you can interact with it using SQL queries to perform various operations such as:

  - Inserting new records
  - Updating existing records
  - Deleting records
  - Retrieving data using complex queries
